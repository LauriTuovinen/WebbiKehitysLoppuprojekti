    <h1 class="h1"> What i can do</h1>
    <p>
    As I mentioned before, I am a computer science student, so I have some 
    experience in coding. I have some experience with electrical devices, 
    mainly with arduino. <br>
    I have some experience with C++, plain C and mySQL from my first year of 
    studies. <br>
    From my second year of studies I already have some experience with Java, a little bit of javascript and webprogramming, mainly with HTML and CSS.
    I have a little work experience with CNC programming. Mainly I have 
    experience with manual machining machines. For example a surfacegrinding
    machine.
